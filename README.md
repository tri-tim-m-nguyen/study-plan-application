## Introduction

Welcome to our Study Plan Application! This website helps university students balance their workload by creating activities, scheduling timeslots, tracking assessments, and comparing timetables.

---

## How the Website Works

1. **Unauthenticated Access**: New users can view the home, signup, and login pages without an account.
2. **Registration & Login**: Create a unique username and password (meeting requirements) to register. Credentials are stored securely.
3. **Activities**:

   * After logging in, users can create up to **10 activities**, including at least **1 unit** activity. Up to **4 units** are special.
   * Activities can be renamed or recolored.
   * Users highlight timeslots on the timetable to assign activities (e.g., lectures, labs).
   * Timeslots can be marked as `fully` or `partially` available.
   * Save all changes to the database.
4. **Assessments**:

   * Upload assessments by selecting a unit, entering name, scored marks, total marks, and weightage.
   * Drag-and-drop to rearrange, edit, or delete assessments.
   * Validations prevent negative values.
5. **Compare Page**:

   * View your timetable (read-only) and send requests to other users by username.
   * Pending requests appear in the navbar; recipients can accept or reject.
   * Accepted links allow viewing another userâ€™s timetable (other activities are greyed out).
   * Remove linked users at any time.
6. **Analytics Page**:

   * Displays average time spent on each activity.
   * Shows average grade per unit from uploaded assessments.
   * Helps students allocate study time effectively.
